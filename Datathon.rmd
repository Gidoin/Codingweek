## Let's get started

---
## Datathon organisation

### 3 goals :

1) Make you work, by team, on real public policies issues **through a data point of view**

--

2) **Design a possible solution** to the issue you analysed

--

3) **Share your results** both online (Github & Medium) and offline

## Introduction to open data

---
## Open data principles

### 1. Completeness

#### Datasets released by the government should be as complete as possible, .red[reflecting the entirety of what is recorded] about a particular subject. 

#### All raw information from a dataset should be released to the public, .red[except to private information] and information that may be sensitive for .red[national safety]


---
## Open data principles

### 2. Primacy / Raw data

####  Datasets released by the government should be .red[primary source data]

---
## Open data principles

### 3. Timely data

#### Datasets released by the government should be available to the public .red[as soon as possible]

---
## Open data principles

###  4. Ease of Physical and Electronic Access

#### Datasets released by the government should be as accessible as possible, with accessibility defined as .red[the ease with which information can be obtained], whether through physical or electronic means

---
## Open data principles

### 5. Machine readability

####  Machines can handle certain kinds of inputs much better than others. Information shared in the widely-used PDF format, for example, is very difficult for machines to parse

#### Thus, information should be stored in widely-used file formats that easily lend themselves to machine processing.

---
## Open data principles

### 6. Non-discriminatory access to data

#### “Non-discrimination” refers to who can access data and how they must do so

#### non-discriminatory access to data means that .red[any person can access the data at any time without having to identify him/herself] or provide any justification for doing so.

---
## Open data principles

### 7. Open standards

#### Open standards refer to who owns the format in which data is stored

--

#### Microsoft .red[Excel] is a fairly commonly-used spreadsheet program which costs money to use. Freely available alternative formats often exist by which stored data can be accessed without the need for a software license

---
## Open data principles

### 8. Open Licence 

#### Maximal openness includes clearly .red[labeling public information] as a work of the government and .red[available without restrictions on use] as part of the public domain

#### In France two type of licences : .red[Licence Ouverte (CC-BY)] ou .red[ODBL (CC-BY-SA)]. Do you know the difference ?

--

- **LO (from Etalab) / ODBL** : with both you can share, edit the database, create derived products and had a commercial usage

- **LO** : more "permissive" : you just have to mention the source and the date of update

- **ODBL** : you have to share and open your database at the same conditions

---
## Challenge 1 : data findability


> Data findability is a major challenge. We have data portals and registries, but government agencies under one national government still publish data in different ways and different locations.(…)
**Data findability is a prerequisite for open data to fulfill its potential and currently most data is very hard to find.**

## Défi 2 : data quality

<BR><BR><BR>

> **Government data is usually incomplete, out of date, of low quality, and fragmented.** In most cases, open data catalogues or portals are manually fed as the result of informal data management approaches. **Procedures, timelines, and responsibilities are frequently unclear among government institutions tasked with this work.**

## Launch of the datathon

## Topics & groups

Here are the 6 topics

- **Do the French students cost too much ?**
- ** Do the French public servants cost too much ?** *.red[Grand débat National]*
- ** So as to reduce the public debt and taxes, which public spendings shall be cut off in priority ?** *.red[Grand débat National]*
- ** Are there too many representatives in France ?**
- ** Are French representatives paid too much ?**
- ** Are French public services too concentrated in the cities ?** *.red[Grand débat National]*

You have 20 minutes to form a group of 5-6 students with at least 2 "advanced" students
